# IoT-BASED-AUTOMATIC-STREET-LIGHTING-SYSTEM
* The present project aims to describe a method for controlled switching ON and OFF  of street lights and regulate their illumination by using sensors with minimum electrical  energy consumption. 
* When presence is detected, all surrounding street lights glow at their  brightest mode, else they stay in the dim mode. 
* LED bulbs were implemented as they are  better than conventional incandescent bulbs. These bulbs also reduce heat emissions, power  consumption, maintenance, replacement costs and carbon dioxide emissions.
